				<p> Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her artistry, songwriting and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, while her life is a subject of widespread media coverage. </p>
				<p> Swift began professional songwriting at 14. She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats and brought Swift mainstream fame. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on her next albums, Speak Now (2010) and Red (2012), respectively, with the latter featuring her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". Swift recalibrated her image from country to pop with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do". </p>
				<p> After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor's Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs "Cruel Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero", "All Too Well", and "Is It Over Now?". Her Eras Tour (2023â€“2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021). </p>
				<p> One of the world's best-selling musicians, Swift has sold over 200 million records as of 2019. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. Six of her albums have opened with over one million sales in a week. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards; she has won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year a record four times each. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift"> Wikipedia) </a> </p> <br> <br>

					<br> <br> <p> Fearless (Taylor's Version) is the first re-recorded album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on April 9, 2021, by Republic Records.

					<p> Fearless (Taylor's Version) is a country pop album composed of acoustic instruments such as guitars, banjo, fiddle, and strings. The lyrics are about Swift's adolescent reflections and feelings on love and heartbreak. Swift and Christopher Rowe produced the re-recorded tracks, and they feature identical arrangements as with the original but their instruments and vocals are more defined and controlled. Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner worked with Swift to produce the vault tracks, which have an indie- and-electronic-oriented soundscape brought by synthesizers and drum programming. Two vault tracks feature guest vocals from Maren Morris and Keith Urban respectively. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor%27s_Version)"> Wikipedia) </a> </p>

					<br> <br> <p> 1989 (Taylor's Version) is the fourth re-recorded album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It is a re-recording of Swift's fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and was released on October 27, 2023, by Republic Records. The album is part of Swift's ongoing response to a 2019 dispute regarding the masters of her back catalog. It was announced at the final Los Angeles show of the Eras Tour on August 9, 2023. </p>
					<p> A 1980s-inspired synth-pop album, 1989 (Taylor's Version) is characterized by upbeat arrangements of synthesizers and percussion.

					<br> <br> <p> Reputation (stylized in all lowercase) is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on November 10, 2017, and it was her last album under Big Machine Records. Secluding herself from public appearances, Swift conceived Reputation as a response to the media scrutiny after her previous album, 1989 (2014), propelled her toward pop stardom. </p>
					<p> Publicized celebrity disputes and romantic relationships inspired the album's songs, which are about anger, vengeance, and ultimately finding solace in love. Swift worked mainly with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, and Shellback to produce Reputation, an electropop and R&B record with elements of urban styles such as hip hop, trap, and EDM. Its densely arranged electronic sound is characterized by programmed drum machines, pulsating synthesizers and bass, and manipulated vocals. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_(album)"> Wikipedia) </a> </p>

					<br> <br> <p> Lover is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 23, 2019, by Republic Records. It is her first album after her departure from Big Machine Records. </p>
					<p> Swift recorded Lover after finishing her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour, having recalibrated her personal life and artistic direction following the public controversies that preceded her previous studio album, Reputation (2017). She produced Lover with Jack Antonoff, Joel Little, Louis Bell, and Frank Dukes. Described by Swift as a "lover letter to love", the album explores wide-ranging emotions like infatuation, commitment, lust, and heartache; a few songs discuss political issues such as LGBT rights and feminism. The production incorporates a 1980s-inspired electropop, pop rock, and synth-pop sound characterized by atmospheric synthesizers, mid-tempo rhythms, and acoustic instruments, with eclectic elements of country, folk, and funk. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lover_(album)"> Wikipedia) </p>

					<br> <br> <p> Folklore (stylized in all lowercase) is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album, released on July 24, 2020, via Republic Records. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Swift canceled the concert tour for her seventh studio album Lover (2019). She conceived Folklore during quarantine as "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness", working with producers Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually; Dessner and Antonoff operated from recording studios in the Hudson Valley and New York City, respectively, while Swift recorded her vocals in a home studio at her Los Angeles residence. </p>
					<p> Departing from the mainly upbeat pop production of its predecessors, Folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by piano, guitars, strings, and muted percussions, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock, and electro-acoustic styles. Influenced by the isolation of quarantine, Swift explores themes of escapism, empathy, nostalgia and romanticism in the album, using a set of characters, fictional narratives, and story arcs, in contrast to the autobiographical tone of her previous projects. The title was inspired by the lasting legacy of folk songs, whereas its visual aesthetic reflects cottagecore. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)"> Wikipedia) </a> </p>

					<br> <br> <p> Evermore (stylized in all lowercase) is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album released on December 11, 2020, via Republic Records, less than five months after her previous studio album Folklore. Evermore was a spontaneous product of Swift's extended collaboration with her Folklore collaborator Aaron Dessner, mainly recorded at his Long Pond Studio in the Hudson Valley. </p>
					<p> Swift described Evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods"â€”an escapist, cottagecore-inspired direction she first ideated with Folklore during the COVID-19 pandemic; she regards them as sister albums. Evermore blends alternative rock, indie folk and chamber pop styles, carried by fingerpicked guitars, somber pianos, lavish strings, and sparse percussion. Impressionist storytelling and mythopoeia dominate its lyrical technique. The subject matter has been described as an anthology of tales about love, marriage, infidelity, and grief, exploring the complexities of human emotion. American bands Bon Iver, Haim, and the National appear as guest performers on the album. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)"> Wikipedia) </a> </p>

The autobiographical songwriting explores broad emotions such as regrets, self-criticism, fantasies, heartbreak, and infatuation, using confessional yet cryptic lyrics that allude to her personal life and public image. </p>
					<p> Swift and Jack Antonoff produced the standard edition of Midnights, which features a subdued electronic soundscape consisting of mid-tempo rhythms, retro synthesizers, sparse drum machine beats, and digitally manipulated vocals. Music critics categorize the album into pop styles of synth-pop, electropop, dream pop, and bedroom pop. The songs infuse electronica, hip hop, R&B, and alternative elements. Sounwave, Jahaan Sweet, and Keanu Beats shared credits on two tracks, and Aaron Dessner produced additional songs for an extended 3am Edition that was surprise-released three hours after the standard edition. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights"> Wikipedia) </a> </p>

					<br> <br> <p> The Tortured Poets Department (also shortened to Tortured Poets) is the upcoming eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, set for release on April 19, 2024, through Republic Records. Swift announced the album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, after winning Best Pop Vocal Album for her tenth studio album, Midnights (2022). </p>
					<p> Shortly after finishing work on Midnights, Swift conceived The Tortured Poets Department and developed it during the Eras Tour (2023â€“2024). She described the album as her "lifeline" record, a product of imperative songwriting. It consists of sixteen songs, featuring collaborations with American rapper Post Malone and the English indie rock band Florence and the Machine. The physical formats of the album include bonus tracks. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortured_Poets_Department"> Wikipedia) </a> </p>

				<p> The Eras Tour is the ongoing sixth concert tour by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Consisting of 152 shows across five continents, the tour commenced on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, United States, and is set to conclude on December 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada. With a global cultural impact, the Eras Tour became the first tour to surpass $1 billion in revenue, making it the highest-grossing of all time. </p> 
				<p> Announced after the release of her tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), the Eras Tour is Swift's second all-stadium tour after the 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour. Each show spans over 3.5 hours, with a set list of 44 songs grouped into 10 distinct acts that portray the albums conceptually. It has received highly positive reviews from critics, emphasizing its concept, production, aesthetics and immersive ambience, as well as Swift's musicianship, vocals, stage presence and versatility. </p>
				<p> The tour recorded unprecedented demand, ticket sales, venue attendance and technical obstacles that have led to imposition of price regulation and anti-scalping laws. Ticketmaster, an official ticketing partner, was scrutinized for its controversially ineffective sales of the tour's tickets and an alleged monopoly in the concert industry. The tour bolstered economies, businesses, and tourism worldwide; dominated news cycles and social media engagement; and garnered tributes and accolades from various governments and organizations. </p>
				<p> Swift announced and released various works during the tour: the re-recorded albums Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), the music videos for "Karma" and "I Can See You", editions of Midnights and her upcoming studio album The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and "Cruel Summer" as a single. An accompanying concert film was released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023; it was met with critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing concert film in history. <br> (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_eras_tour"> Wikipedia) </a> </p> <br> <br> <br> <br>
